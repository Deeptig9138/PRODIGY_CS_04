Algorithm for keylogger.py


1. Initialize Keylogger:
    - Define the log file name (`log_file = 'keylog.txt'`).
    - Print a message indicating the keylogger has started and how to quit.

2. Open Log File:
    - Use a context manager to open the log file in append mode (`'a'`).

3. Start Infinite Loop:
    - Enter a `while True` loop to continuously capture keyboard events.

4. Capture Keyboard Events:
    - Use `keyboard.read_event()` to capture each keyboard event.

5. Check Event Type:
    - If the event is a key press (`event.event_type == keyboard.KEY_DOWN`):
        - Retrieve the key name (`key = event.name`).

6. Handle Special Keys:
    - If the key length is greater than 1, format it by enclosing in square brackets (`if len(key) > 1: key = f"[{key}]"`).

7. Log Key:
    - Write the key to the log file without adding a newline (`f.write(key)`).
    - Print the logged key on the same line in the console (`print(f"Key logged: {key}", end=' ', flush=True)`).

8. Check for Quit Key:
    - If the key is `'q'`, print a message indicating the keylogger has stopped and break the loop.

9. Handle Interrupt:
    - Use a `try-except` block to handle `KeyboardInterrupt` (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) to gracefully exit the loop.

10. Main Execution:
    - If the script is run directly, call the `keylogger()` function.
